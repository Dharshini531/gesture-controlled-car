# Gesture Controlled Car

This project demonstrates a two-part gesture-controlled car system:
- **Transmitter**: Reads hand gestures using MPU6050 and transmits commands (e.g., FORWARD, LEFT).
- **Receiver**: Receives commands and drives motors using L293D.

## ðŸ§  Working Principle
- Tilting the hand triggers gesture commands.
- Commands are sent wirelessly (RF/HC-12).
- The receiver controls DC motors via L293D IC based on the received commands.

## ðŸ§° Components Used
- Arduino UNO Ã—2
- MPU6050
- RF433 or HC-12 Tx/Rx
- L293D Motor Driver
- DC Motors Ã—2
- Battery (9V or more)
- Tinkercad for receiver simulation
